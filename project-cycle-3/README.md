# Project Cycle 3 - Two-Sample Inference

- **Group Number:** 9
- **Members:** [113370202方立謙], [113370224 巴以甯][cite: 1]
- **Research Question:** Is the mean body weight different between male and female students? (Question 4)
- **Variables:**
    - **Group Variable:** `WhatIsYourSex` (1 = Male, 2 = Female)
    - **Response Variable:** `HowMuchDoYouWeighWithoutShoesInKG` (Quantitative)
- **Key Method:** Welch's Two-Sample t-test
- **Assumptions:** 
    - The two groups are independent.
    - Large sample size (n > 30) justifies the use of t-test.
    - We do not assume equal variance (Welch's).
- **Conclusion:** With a P-value < 0.001, we reject the null hypothesis. There is a significant difference in mean body weight between male and female students.
